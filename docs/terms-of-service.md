**Movi Player — Web Player, Chrome Extension & Google Drive integration**

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Movi Player, an open-source video player that runs in your web browser. By using Movi Player — including the website at [moviplayer.com](https://moviplayer.com), the Chrome extension, or the "Open with Movi Player" Google Drive integration — you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the service.

## Description of Service

Movi Player is a client-side video player powered by WebCodecs and FFmpeg WebAssembly. All video decoding and playback happen locally in your browser. Movi Player does not host, store, or stream video content from our own servers.

## Google Drive Integration

Movi Player offers an optional integration that lets you play video files stored in your own Google Drive.

- Access is **read-only**. Movi Player never edits, deletes, moves, shares, renames, or uploads any file in your Drive.
- When you open a video, Movi Player streams the file's bytes directly from Google's servers to your browser (using ranged HTTP requests) and decodes them locally for playback.
- File contents are **never sent to, stored on, or logged by any server operated by us**, and are never shared with any third party.
- You may revoke Movi Player's access to your Google account at any time via [Google Account permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).

Movi Player's use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements.

## Your Responsibilities

You are responsible for the content you choose to play with Movi Player. You agree to use the service only with content that you own or are otherwise legally permitted to access and play, and only in compliance with all applicable laws. You may not use Movi Player to access, distribute, or reproduce content in violation of any third party's rights.

## Upstream Open Source & License

The original Movi Player is open-source software released under the Apache-2.0 License. You may review, use, and modify its source code at [github.com/MrUjjwalG/movi-player](https://github.com/MrUjjwalG/movi-player) in accordance with that license. This upstream grant does not apply to Suvio's proprietary Kotlin/Wasm player implementation.

## Disclaimer of Warranties

Movi Player is provided **"as is" and "as available"**, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or compatible with every file, codec, browser, or device.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall the developers or contributors of Movi Player be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, arising out of or related to your use of — or inability to use — the service.

## Third-Party Services

The Google Drive integration relies on Google APIs and is subject to [Google's Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) and the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy). Your use of any content you play remains subject to the terms of the source from which it originates.

## Privacy

Your use of Movi Player is also governed by our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy), which explains what data is (and is not) collected.

## Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of Movi Player after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
